bergwerkLABS - Friends
============================

Friend system for multiproxy Minecraft networks.

Why is this Open Source?
------------------------

Since the server closed, I decided to open source my work for other people to see how things were done.
Feel free to use this code for your own Minecraft network, if you have one.
